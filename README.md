# Base&Arm_ControlPanel

A project for SmartMethods Internship, the software development process of a robotic base&arm.

-First, I designed a Web page to control the Base of arm  , API (Application Programming Interface) using html, css, javascript to controls the movement of the base, then I combined the two web pages into one page to make it easy to a user to controol both at the same page.

Also, I add a helpful additions which are : 
   
  1- Number boxes shows the last saved value.
  
  2- Bouttons to choose some special angles (180-90-45-30) and to reset (0) .
  
  3- The last Engine can be hidden .

-After that I designed a database with table(Direction) and I previously add the (Engines,Run) tables then I conected it with the Interface to insert values of each engine, direction and where it on  into corresponding columns of the table.

These  tasks are in base.php file and ROBOT_CONTROLLERS.sql

-Then I designed 3 Web pages to display the last record inserted in Directions,Engines and Run tables which contained the value of the Direction which the last user choosen.
-Directions.php-

-Engines.php-

-Run.php-

-Finally, I made the web page responsive to a Tablets and mobile phones .

While I was developing I faced two problems,which are: 

1-(span element) which have value of range slider doesn't show the value while I move it on mobile view, I found that onmousemove event is the source of problem so, I use onchange (for mobile and tablet pages) & onmouseover (for desktop page).

2-The value of range slider doesn't change when I click any of special angeles buttons, I tried untill finally solved it by connect the slider value (span element) with the input type "number" and then connect the it whith buttons.
