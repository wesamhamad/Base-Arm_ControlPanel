# Base-Arm_ControlPanel
# Robot-arm_ControlPanel

A project for SmartMethods Internship, the software development process of a robotic base&arm.

-Firest, I designed a Web page to control the Base of arm  , API (Application Programming Interface) using html, css, javascript to controls the movement of the base .

-Then I copmined the two web pages into one page to make it easy to a user to controol both at the same page , I add a helpful additions which are : 
   1- Text box show the last saved value.
   2- Bouttons to choose some special angles and to reset .
   3- The last Engine can be hidden .
   
-After that I designed a database with one tables(Direction) and I previously add the (Engines,Run) tables then I conected it with the Interface to insert values of each engine, direction and where it on  into corresponding column of the table.

These  tasks are in base.php file 

-Then I designed a Web page -Directions.php- to display the last record inserted in Directions table which contained the value of the Direction which the last user choosed.
